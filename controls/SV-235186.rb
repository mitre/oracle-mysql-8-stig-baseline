  title "The MySQL Database Server 8.0 must maintain the confidentiality and
integrity of information during preparation for transmission."
  desc  "Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or
modified during preparation for transmission, including, for example, during
aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking.
These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality
or integrity of the information.

    Use of this requirement will be limited to situations where the data owner
has a strict requirement for ensuring data integrity and confidentiality is
maintained at every step of the data transfer and handling process.

    When transmitting data, the DBMS, associated applications, and
infrastructure must leverage transmission protection mechanisms.

    If the data owner does not have a strict requirement for ensuring data
integrity and confidentiality is maintained at every step of the data transfer
and handling process, this is not a finding.

    Run the following:
    select @@require_secure_transport;

    The value should be 1 (ON) versus 0 (OFF), if the value is 0 (OFF), this is
a finding.
  "
  desc 'fix', "
    Turn on require_secure_transport. In this mode the server permits only
TCP/IP connections encrypted using TLS/SSL, or connections that use a socket
file (on UNIX) or shared memory (on Windows).

    The server rejects nonsecure connection attempts, which fail with an
ER_SECURE_TRANSPORT_REQUIRED error.
