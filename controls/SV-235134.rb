  title "The MySQL Database Server 8.0, when utilizing PKI-based
authentication, must validate certificates by performing RFC 5280-compliant
certification path validation."
  desc  "The #{input('org_name')} standard for authentication is #{input('org_name')}-approved PKI certificates.

    A certificate's certification path is the path from the end entity
certificate to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path
validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision
regarding acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path
validation includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity, and
revocation status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation
status information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is
commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online certificate
status protocol (OCSP) responses.

    Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates by performing
RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation are in danger of accepting
certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized
access to the database.

    The database supports PKI-based authentication by using digital
certificates over TLS in addition to the native encryption and data integrity
capabilities of these protocols.

    Review MySQL Database Server 8.0 configuration to verify DBMS user account
certificates are valid by performing RFC 5280-compliant certification path
validation.

    Run the following command to determine the certificate in use along with
other details:
    select @@ssl_ca, @@ssl_capath, @@ssl_cert, @@ssl_cipher, @@ssl_crl,
@@ssl_crlpath, @@ssl_fips_mode, @@ssl_key;

    If ssl_crl is not set to a CRL file, this is a finding.

    If ssl_crlpath is empty then use the default, which is the datadir path. To
get that path run select @@datadir.

    Next verify the existence of the CRL file.

    If the CRL file does not exist, this is a finding.

    Next, verify that require_secure_transport is ON by running:
    select @@require_secure_transport;

    If require_secure_transport is not 1 for ON, this is a finding.

    If the certificate is not a #{input('org_name')} approved certificate, or if no certificate
is listed, this is a finding.

    Confirm Issuer and Subject map to the username. Run the following script:
    SELECT `user`.`Host`,
        `user`.`User`,
        `user`.`ssl_type`,
        CAST(`user`.`x509_issuer` as CHAR) as Issuer,
        CAST(`user`.`x509_subject` as CHAR) as Subject
    FROM `mysql`.`user`;

    If user accounts are not being mapped to authenticated identities, this is
a finding.

    Configure the DBMS to validate certificates by constructing a certification
path with status information to an accepted trust anchor.

    Configure the database server to support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
protocols.
    mysql> set persist require_secure_transport=ON;

    Set system variables on the server side specify #{input('org_name')} approved certificate
and key files the server uses when permitting clients to establish encrypted
connections:

    ssl_ca: The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.
(ssl_capath is similar but specifies the path name of a directory of CA
certificate files.)

    ssl_cert: The path name of the server public key certificate file. This
certificate can be sent to the client and authenticated against the CA
certificate that it has.

    ssl_key: The path name of the server private key file.

    For example, to enable the server for encrypted connections with
certificates, start it with these lines in the my.cnf file, changing the file
names as necessary:

    [mysqld]
    ssl_ca=ca.pem
    ssl_cert=server-cert.pem
    ssl_key=server-key.pem
    Alter users to require X509 certificates

    Below is an example to add X509 as a requirement.

    For a new user
    CREATE USER 'jeffrey'@'localhost' REQUIRE X509;
    AND SUBJECT '/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Houston/O=SomeCompany/CN=Johan Smith'
      AND ISSUER '/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Houston/O=SomeCompany/CN=Some CA';

    Or to add to an existing user
    ALTER USER 'johansmith'@'%'
    REQUIRE X509
      AND SUBJECT '/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Houston/O=SomeCompany/CN=Johan Smith'
      AND ISSUER '/C=US/ST=Texas/L=Houston/O=SomeCompany/CN=Some CA';
